# LearnYouAJavascript
Project title: Script You a Javascript

Target age: 11-13

Materials, software, equipment needed for the project: 
You only require the website.

The objective of the project and a short description: 
The aim of ScriptYouAJavaScript is to showcase fundamental programming techniques to students who have very little to no programming experience. 

A list of the tasks you have completed and a list of the tasks outstanding:
Done:
Basic website construction
Javascript interpreter working and linked to player animations
First 3 levels implemented
Artwork finished

To do:
Design levels covering more advanced topics (if, for, while, arrays...)
Design levels where users create their own functions?
User input / output? (confirm, prompt…etc.)

About us:		
Asim Ali
Hello, i’m a first year Computer Science student studying at UCL. 
My inspiration for pursuing a career in this field stems from my passion for online video games. 
I am looking forward to developing games of my own in the years to come. 
I highly recommend the study of computation due to the wide scope of applications available to you as a programmer. 
Computer Science paves the way forward for developments in both creativity and problem solving unlike any other degree! 
ScriptYouAJavascipt will provide only a glimpse of what you can achieve in the world of programming.

Ryan Collins
Hey, my name is Ryan, and like the rest of my team I am a first year computer science student at UCL. 
My interest in all things computer related was sparked at an early age, thanks to my family being very technology oriented, 
and my elder brother's constant encouragement to start programming. I think that learning to program is very 
important skill for everyone to have, yet I know that it can quite boring at first, 
this is why i was so enthusiastic when we were given this project, as we could make a way to learn beginner level coding and 
have it be fun at the same time, because what's more fun than playing video games!

Marti Serra
Hi there! I’m Marti and I’m studying CS at UCL. I’ve always been interested in technology and specially computers. 
I love programming because it allows me to develop both my creativity and technical abilities while creating amazing things 
that people around the world can use. 

Hai “Felix” Xia
Hi, I am a first year computer science student at UCL. 
My interest in coding stems from the central paradigm that comes with every coding language: a logical thought process. 
I enjoy learning through doing and playing as I find it more engaging and rewarding. 
Hence why I believe our interactive learning game is a must-have experience for you to get started in Javascript!
