            <h1>Welcome to Script You a Javascript.</h1>
            <p>
                This website is the home of a game which can teach you the fundamentals
                of using Javascript through the use of a fun but educational game.
            </p>
            <p>
                To navigate around this website please use the top bar.
                Placing your cursor on some of the menu items will change the contents of
                this text box, even the logo in the top left corner, will bring back up this
                text.

            <h1>Why should you use this website?</h1>
            <p>
                We have specifically designed this website to help people who have none to limited
                prior knowledge of Javascript and programming in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide an environment in which you can type your code, which we will help you to
                write, as well providing detailed documentation in which to help you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be done by clicking on the Play Game menu item, which will take you the game screen
                where you will be able to solve problems and challenges in the game environment with what
                you have programmed in Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each level will have tutorial, and a help option available, though we do suggest that
                you try to find a solution before looking at the help we offer.

                Hello, i’m a first year Computer Science student studying at UCL. My inspiration for pursuing a career in
                this field stems from my passion for online video games. I am looking forward to developing games of my own in the years to come.
                I highly recommend the study of computation due to the wide scope of applications available to you as a programmer.
                Computer Science paves the way forward for developments in both creativity and problem solving unlike any other degree!
                ScriptYouAJavascipt will provide only a glimpse of what you can achieve in the world of programming.

                Hi, I am a first year computer science student at UCL. My interest in coding stems from the
                central paradigm that comes with every coding language: a logical thought process. I enjoy
                learning through doing and playing as I find it more engaging and rewarding. Hence why I
                believe our interactive learning game is a must-have experience for you to get started in Javascript!
            </p>
            <h1>Ryan Collins</h1>
            <p>
                Hey, my name is Ryan, and like the rest of my team I am a first year computer science student
                at UCL. My interest in all things computer related was sparked at an early age, thanks to my
                family being very technology oriented, and my elder brother's constant encouragement to start
                programming. I think that learning to program is very important skill for everyone to have, yet I
                know that it can quite boring at first, this is why i was so enthusiastic when we were given this
                project, as we could make a way to learn beginner level coding and have it be fun at the same time,
                because what's more fun than playing video games!
            </p>
            <h1>Marti Serra</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! I’m Marti and I’m from Barcelona, but I study CS at UCL. I’ve always been interested by technology
                and specially everything related to computers. I love programming because it allows me to develop both my
                creativity and technical abilities while creating amazing things that people around the world can use. In
                addition, I enjoy learning very much, so I’m always eager to discover new programming languages.
