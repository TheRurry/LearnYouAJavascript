            <h1>Welcome to Script You a Javascript.</h1>
            <p>
                This website is the home of a game which can teach you the fundamentals
                of using Javascript through the use of a fun but educational game.
            </p>
            <p>
                To navigate around this website please use the top bar.
                Placing your cursor on some of the menu items will change the contents of
                this monitor, even the logo in the top left corner, will bring back up this
                text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking on any of the menu items will take you to a different website.
                The logo will also take you back to this home page, and the social media menu
                item requires you to click on one the options on the menu items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scrolling down the page will reveal additional information, such as additional
                websites you can use in order to further your learning and understanding of the
                Javascript language.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="screenTwo">
            <h1>Why should you use this website?</h1>
            <p>
                We have specifically designed this website to help people who have none to limited
                prior knowledge of Javascript and programming in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide an environment in which you can type your code, which we will help you to
                write, as well providing detailed documentation in which to help you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be done by clicking on the Play Game menu item, which will take you the game screen
                where you will be able to solve problems and challenges in the game environment with what
                you have programmed in Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each level will have tutorial, and a help option available, though we do suggest that
                you try to find a solution before looking at the help we offer.

            <h1>Asim Ali</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Asim Ali. And I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs I fight crime and find other metahumans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am the Flashbang.
            </p>
            <h1>Hai Felix Xia</h1>
            <p>
                I don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you want. If you are looking for the source code, I can tell you I don’t have it. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you play the game now, that’ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don’t, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.
            </p>
            <h1>Ryan Collins</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ryan Collins. After five years in hell, I have come home with only one goal - to save my city. But my old approach wasn't enough. I had to become someone else. I had to become something else. I had to become Global Elite.

            <p>
                Hi there! I’m Marti and I’m from Barcelona, but I study CS at UCL. I’ve always been interested by technology and specially everything related to computers. I love programming because it allows me to develop both my creativity and technical abilities while creating amazing things that people around the world can use. In addition, I enjoy learning very much, so I’m always eager to discover new programming languages.

<!--Hi, I am a first year computer science student at UCL. My interest in coding stems from the central paradigm that comes with every coding language: a logical thought process. I enjoy learning through doing and playing as I find it more engaging and rewarding. Hence why I believe our interactive learning game is a must-have experience for you to get started in Javascript!-->
